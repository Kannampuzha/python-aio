# Conversion of Standard Numeral System
Usually we humans use base-10 [Numeral System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numeral_system).  
Base-10 numeral system is referred as Decimal System.  

Although decimal system is intuitively simple, use cases in different domains often are efficient with other number systems in action.

# Usage
`converter.py` program can be used to convert a number to its binary equivalent. The algorithm used is not limited to Leibniz's binary system and can be broadly used for conversion from decimal to any base x.  

`advconverter.py` program can be used to convert a number to any valid base-system. It uses alphanumeric characters for bases 1 to 36, and there on uses comma notation to make sense of higher bases.
